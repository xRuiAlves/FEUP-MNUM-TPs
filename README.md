In this repository you can find sample implementations of the various numerical methods aproached in the Curricular Unit "Métodos Numéricos" (Numerical Methods) from the 2nd year of the Integrated Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at FEUP - Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto

Note that all the methods in this repository are implemented using Maxima - An Open-Source program for mathematical calculation and much, much more (Described in Sourceforge as: "Maxima, a Computer Algebra System")
Sourceforge free download: http://maxima.sourceforge.net/download.html

Most of the Implementations are based on Professor Dr. Jaime E. Villate books:
Jaime E. Villate - "Métodos Numéricos" - In-Progress Book - ISBN 9789729939631
Jaime E. Villate - "Introdução aos Sistemas Dinâmicos - ISBN 972-99396-0-8
